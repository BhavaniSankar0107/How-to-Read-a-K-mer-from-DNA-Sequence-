K-Mer Finder

Background
This Python script analyzes a DNA sequence stored in a file, identifying and counting the occurrences of k-mers (subsequences of length k). Utilizing the collections module,
it employs a sliding window approach to extract all possible k-mers from the sequence. The script then utilizes the Counter class to tally the occurrences of each unique k-mer. Finally,
it identifies the most frequently occurring k-mer and displays both the sequence and its count. This code is suitable for genetic analysis, aiding in the understanding of repetitive 
patterns within DNA sequences. Try out the code with different k values to find repeated sequences of different lengths.

Before Getting Started
Make sure that collections module is installed in your python environment. Mostly you get this module present in standard library of python
